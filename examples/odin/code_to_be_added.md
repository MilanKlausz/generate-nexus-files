## Future tasks to be added to Jira (Phase 2)

1. Unit tests needs to be added that should be run when updating the data format.
File format for tomography will be frozen but ocassional updates are necessary. Updates
   Should be verified with the unit test. Example test case: provide nexus NICOS FW template JSON to NICOS FW and see if it 
parses it correctly and supplies it with some dummy values.
